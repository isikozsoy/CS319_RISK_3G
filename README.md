Risk is a strategy board game aimed for two to six players of diplomacy, conflict, and conquest.
The standard version of the game consists of a board in which a map of the world is depicted. The
map is divided into forty-two territories which are grouped into six continents. Turns rotate among
players in control of armies with which they attempt to capture territories from other players via battles
whose results are determined by dice rolls. The number of dice a player is able to attack or defend with is
dependent on the number of soldiers that player controls in the applicable territories. The classic goal of
the game is to occupy every territory on the board and achieve total global domination. Both formal and
informal alliances may be formed during the course of the game.

<p> Our project is based on RISK Global Domination, however some certain features will be added/removed, such as: </p>
<p> • We plan on allowing players to be able to leave territories in their control unguarded should they choose to. </p>
<p> • We plan on allowing players to set the goal of capturing a continent before the game starts and receive rewards should they be able to do so. </p>
<p> • We plan on implementing a rock-paper-scissors based combat system where more skill is involved as opposed to dice rolls. </p>

In the original game, players are required to leave at least one unit in any territory that they are in control of. We
plan on allowing players the ability to leave territories they currently control unguarded so as to move the soldiers on 
that territory to any other connected territory that they control. This would make it so that the territory previously controlled
by the player is left empty, such that any other player with a connected territory can capture the empty one without any 
battle required.

We plan on having the players be able to declare a target continent that they will aim to capture before territories
are dealt and the game begins. This would make it so should that player be able to actually conquer that continent they
will receive some additional rewards in addition to the rewards they would have received for simply conquering that continent.

We are planning on implementing a combat system whose results are determined by something more skill based such as rock-paper-scissors
as opposed to just dice rolls. This could serve to eliminate the frustration caused by unlucky dice rolls and add another layer
of complexity/depth to the game.
